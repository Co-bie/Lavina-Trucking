# User Management System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The User Management System is now fully functional with all CRUD operations and user blocking capabilities.

## Features Implemented

### 1. User List & Display
- **Paginated user list** with search and filtering
- **Search by**: Name, email, first name, last name
- **Filter by**: User type (admin, driver, client) and status (active/blocked)
- **Visual status indicators**: Green for active, red (animated) for blocked users
- **User type badges**: Color-coded badges for easy identification

### 2. Add New Users
- **Complete user form** with all necessary fields:
  - First Name, Last Name (required)
  - Email (required, unique validation)
  - Password (required for new users)
  - User Type: Admin, Driver, Client
  - Contact Information: Phone
  - Address: Full address, city, state, ZIP code
  - Hourly Rate (for drivers/contractors)
- **Modal interface** for clean user experience
- **Real-time validation** and error handling

### 3. Edit Users
- **Edit existing users** with pre-populated form
- **Password is optional** when editing (leave blank to keep current)
- **Same comprehensive form** as creation
- **Real-time updates** reflect immediately in the user list

### 4. Block/Unblock Users
- **Toggle user status** with single button click
- **Visual feedback**: Button changes color and icon based on status
- **Animated blocked status** indicator for immediate recognition
- **Confirmation messages** for all status changes

### 5. Delete Users
- **Permanent user deletion** with confirmation dialog
- **Safety confirmation** to prevent accidental deletions
- **Immediate list refresh** after deletion

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (Laravel PHP)

- **Routes**: Defined in `backend/routes/api.php`
- **Database**: MySQL with proper user table structure
- **Validation**: Comprehensive server-side validation
- **Response Format**: Consistent JSON responses with success/error handling
